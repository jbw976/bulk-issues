The Crossplane governance has recently been updated to define the lifecycle and policies for [Community Extension Projects](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-extension-projects).

The steering committee requests that the maintainer team of this repo takes the time to thoroughly read and understand the new [policies](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#policies-for-community-extension-projects) that all community extension projects must comply with.

 Then, please respond on this issue with a self-assessment of how/whether this project is in compliance with the stated policies and any plans for remediation if necessary. If for any reason this project is not able to come into compliance, then this project will be at risk of being archived.

Feel free to reply with questions or reach out to the [steering committee](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#contact-info) if you need any help or guidance, we're here to help make this project successful. Thank you!
