The Crossplane governance has recently been updated to define the lifecycle and policies for [Community Extension Projects](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-extension-projects).

The steering committee requests the maintainer team of this repo to take the time to thoroughly read and understand the new [policies](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#policies-for-community-extension-projects) that all community extension projects must comply with.

Then, please respond on this issue with a self-assessment of how/whether this project is in compliance with the stated policies and any plans for remediation if necessary. If for any reason this project is not able to come into compliance, then this project will be at risk of being archived.

If you have any questions, check out [this discussion](https://github.com/crossplane/org/discussions/87) first, because other projects may also share your same question. if you need any help or guidance, we're here to help make this project successful. Thank you!
